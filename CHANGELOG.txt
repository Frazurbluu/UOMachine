------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine 0.3.2.3 (01/06/2010):

Update:     RazorLoader no longer depends on DEVPATH environment variable or the
            RazorLoader.exe.config file.
Bugfix:     MacroEx.GetMapInfo wasn't working for Ter Mur.  Thanks Reximus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine 0.3.2.2 (11/16/09):

Bugfix:     Argument parser in RazorLoader not working properly.  Thanks Reximus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine 0.3.2.1 (11/14/09):

Bugfix:     MacroEx.SystemMessage wasn't null terminated, causing buffer overflow.
Bugfix:     Script exceptions in event handlers were bubbling up to UOM.  They are now
            caught and logged.
Bugfix:     Fresh install of Razor displays message on every startup about english
            language file if you never change to a different language.
Note:       To use RazorLoader standalone you must first set "DEVPATH" environment
            variable to Razor folder or first run UO Machine once to set the variable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 3 Revision 2 (10/29/09):

Bugfix:     No more force closings of Razor clients.  Razor loader split into it's own
            project;  it's now a console exe.
Bugfix:     Data.Cliloc.GetLocalString(int property, string[] arguments) updated to
            properly parse embedded cliloc strings.
Bugfix:     Double entries are now filtered from WorldItem.Properties.
Update:     WorldItem.Properties (and it's derived types) renamed to PropertyText.  This
            is still decoded item properties stored as a multi-line string.
Update:     WorldItem.Properties (and derived types) is now type UOMachine.Property[].
Update:     Facet.Stygian_Abyss enum entry renamed to Ter_Mur.
Feature:    MacroEx.TestPacket added, mostly for me, which allows an incoming or outgoing
            packet to be sent to UO Machine in order observe how it's handled.
Feature:    UOMachine.Property class added, has 3 properties: string Text which is the
            entire property decoded as a string i.e. "lower reagent cost 14%", int Cliloc
            which is the cliloc entry for the property i.e. 1060434, and string[]
            Arguments which are the arguments for the cliloc i.e. { "14" }.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 3 Revision 1 (10/21/09):

Bugfix:     Error parsing gump layouts with additional random whitespace thrown in. (OSI)
Bugfix:     Support for multiple cliloc tokens in generic gump elements.
Bugfix:     Razor loader now remembers last language used and shuts down more properly.
Bugfix:     MacroEx.Target fixed.
Bugfix:     Bug with Mobile.GetEquippedItem and probably others fixed.
Bugfix:     In trying to fix Razor force closes, found that AppDomains weren't unloading.
Update:     Added some new Stygian Abyss gump elements, I'm probably missing others.
Update:     MacroEx.GumpButtonClick now lets you send text.
Update:     Macro.FindMobiles now overloaded to take an array of IDs to search for.
Update:     Macro.FindItems now overloaded to take an array of IDs to search for.
Update:     Events.General.CustomGumpEvent renamed to GenericGumpEvent.
Feature:    All clients launched from UOM now ignore login.cfg and use the server/port
            from options.
Feature:    Macro.ChangeServer lets you change login server/port for specified client.
Feature:    Macro.LaunchClient allows you to launch a new client.
Feature:    Macro.LaunchRazor allows you to launch a new Razor instance.
Feature:    Always light patch for all ML/SA 2d clients in Options -> Client.
Note:       Currently, closing a UOM Razor client may force close other running Razor 
            clients within UOM.  It's a known issue that I'm working on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 3 (10/09/09):

Bugfix:     Intermittent hang on UO Machine exit.
Bugfix:     ServerListEvent/CharacterListEvent were not cleared on ClearEvents().
Bugfix:     Crash when handling packet 0x3A.

            packet 0x1B is received.
Feature:    Support for future UO clients without waiting for updates.
Feature:    Support for encryption removal for all ML/SA clients, see Options->Client.
            Thanks to Daniel 'Necr0Potenc3' Cavalcanti.

Update:     Events.IncomingPacket.CustomGump renamed to GenericGump.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 2 Revision 4 (09/22/09):

Bugfix:     Fixed resource leak.
Bugfix:     Fixed crash bug with handling incoming packet 0xB0.
Bugfix:     Fixed crash bug related to options.xml and startup.
Feature:    Added support for Razor 1.0.12.4.
Feature:    Added support for client 6.0.14.3/4.
Feature:    Added support for client 7.0.0.0.
Feature:    Added support for client 7.0.0.2.
Feature:    MacroEx.GetMapInfo now supports Stygian Abyss.
Feature:    Events.IncomingPackets.ServerListEvent fires on packet 0xA8.
Feature:    Events.IncomingPackets.CharacterListEvent fires on packet 0xA9.
Feature:    MacroEx.SelectServer sends server select packet to server.
Feature:    Macro.Login logs into game server, selects chosen shard and character.
            It's still kind of crude, but it should be reliable enough.
Feature:    Macro.GetGumpList returns array of GumpInfo objects which describes all
            open gumps in the client, including containers, spell icons, etc.
Update:     UOM.GetAllSkills renamed to GetSkills.
Update:     UOM.GetAllSkillNames renamed to GetSkillNames.
Update:     UOM.GetSkillName now returns empty string on error.
Update:     References to "Custom gumps" renamed to "Generic gumps" to be more in line
            with standard UO terms.
Update:     Majority of methods moved from UOM class to Macro or MacroEx classes
            because it was a little confusing the way it was before.

Following methods moved to UOMachine.Macros.Macro:
CancelTargetCursor, IsTargetCursor, SetTargetCursor, SendText, SendKeys, SendMouseClick,
FindItem, FindItems, FindMobile, FindMobiles, GetItem, GetMobile, GetPlayer,
WriteClientMemory, ReadClientMemory, AddKeyboardMacro, RemoveKeyboardMacro,
ClearKeyboardMacros, GetSkillInfo, GetSkills

Following methods move to UOMachine.Macros.MacroEx:
GetAttackTarget (renamed from GetCurrentAttackTarget), GetMapInfo, GetGenericGump,
GetGenericGumps

NOTE: UO Machine has never been tested by me on OSI servers.  I know packets have
been added/changed.  Crashes will likely occur, and using UOM's packet sending macros
may or may not be detected by OSI as use of a third party utility.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 2 Revision 3 (08/07/09):

Bugfix:     Fixed potential issue with Razor launcher.
Bugfix:     Client launcher wasn't using client path from options.
Bugfix:     Fixed bug with handling packet 0xDD.
Bugfix:     Null reference bug in gump parsing code, now gumps without pages are handled
            correctly.
Update:     UOMachine.Gump class now has GumpElements field for elements with no page.
Update:     Gump.GetNearestElement only searches the page on which the source element
            resides (or GumpElements if element has no parent page).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 2 Revision 2 (07/29/09):

Bugfix:     Item labels with multiple localization tokens now decoded properly.
Bugfix:     Stale item pruning fixed & updated.
Bugfix:     Fixed one of the MacroEx.DropItem overloads.
Feature:    Added support for client 6.0.14.1
Feature:    Added support for client 6.0.14.2
Feature:    Custom Razor launcher.  Razor now launches in a separate AppDomain from within 
            UO Machine.  If UO Machine closes while Razor is running it will remain
            running in the background until Razor exits.
Feature:    Generic in memory multi UO patch for all ML 2D clients.
Feature:    Events.IncomingPackets.CustomGumpEvent fires on packet 0xDD and 0xB0.
Feature:    Events.General.CustomGumpEvent fires on parsed gump, passes Gump object.
Feature:    Events.LowLevel.ClearEvents() method added for resetting events.
Feature:    MacroEx.GumpButtonClick sends button click packet to server.
Feature:    MacroEx.CloseClientGump sends close gump packet to client.
Feature:    UOM.GetGump gets gump with specified ID from target client.
Feature:    UOM.GetGumps gets all gumps for target client.
Feature:    UOM.FindGump gets gump with specified serial from target client.
Feature:    Gump class encapsulates parsed custom gumps.  Most elements are parsed, 
            except for "group", looking for example of that one. GumpElements are 
            contained in GumpPages.  Exposed methods allow scripts to close gumps, click
            gump buttons, search for GumpElements by ID or Type, and search for closest 
            GumpElement (with optional filtering by type).
Update:     TreeView now has "Last gump action" entry under Last actions.  Also a 
            "Custom gumps" entry under Status which shows number of custom gumps open.
Update:     Options updated, new Razor tab in Options window.  New server and port 
            entry in options.  Currently this is only used for launching Razor, clients
            still need to use login.cfg for now. Old options.xml are invalid, sorry.
Update:     On script stop all public events are now reset.  This will help prevent any
            event code in your previously compiled scripts from executing.
Update:     Lots of little changes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 2 Revision 1 (07/02/09):

Bugfix:     Oops, I broke UOM.SendPacketToClient when I updated the asm code.
Bugfix:     Equipping/unequipping items now properly updates players/mobiles.
Bugfix:     UOM sometimes attaches to wrong client w/Razor.  Still not perfect.

Feature:    IncomingPackets.AttackEndedEvent added.  RunUO doesn't seem to
            send this packet
Feature:    IncomingPackets.AttackSwingEvent added.  Fired on weapon swing.
Feature:    IncomingPackets.LoggedOutEvent added.  This event doesn't seem to
            fire on standard logouts.
Feature:    IncomingPackets.AttackTargetEvent added.  This is current attack
            target. Serial 0 = combat ended.
Feature:    UOM.GetCurrentAttackTarget added.
Feature:    MacroEx.Click added.
Feature:    MacroEx.Attack added.
Feature:    MacroEx.SystemMessage added.  Sends system message to client.
Feature:    MacroEx.LogOut added.
Update:     UOMachine.PlayerMobile now exposes Client field which shows which
            client instance the object is linked to
Update:     All integer references to item layer replaced with Layer enum.
Update:     Removed some old unnecessary Interlocked calls.
Update:     XY positions for container items enabled.
Update:     Updated stale item removal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 2 (06/25/09):

Bugfix:     Lowered risk of high CPU usage bug by delaying DLL injection a bit.
Feature:    Added support for client 6.0.13.1
Feature:    UOM.SendText(int client, string text): Send unicode string to
            client as simulated keystrokes.  Escaped chars do work, i.e. "\r"
Feature:    UOM.SendKeys(int client, Keys[] keys): Send array of keys to
            client as simulated keystrokes. Useful for system keys.
Feature:    UOM.SendMouseClick allows you to send mouse clicks to relative
            position within the client window.  Restores window / moves mouse.
Feature:    Macro.Pathfind: Client pathfind macro
Feature:    MacroEx.ContextMenu: Request mob's context menu
Feature:    MacroEx.ContextMenuClick: Click menu entry in mob's context menu
Feature:    UOM.GetJournal: get journal for specified client.  Journal is
            not actual client journal, but a custom implementation based on
            a generic thread safe circular buffer.
Feature:    UOMachine.Events.IncomingPackets.ContextMenuEvent: fired on
            receipt of context menu entries.  Allows scripts to examine
            properties of each entry (text, color, etc.) and send click packet.
Feature:    UOMachine.Events.General.JournalEntryEvent: fired when entry is 
            added to any of UOM's journals.
Update:     Completely revamped event system.  Public events are now fully
            thread safe.  Public/internal events/internal event handlers now 
            located in UOMachine.Events namespace.  Sorry for broken scripts.
Update:     Mouse position in TreeView now displayed as relative position
            to client window instead of the absolute screen position.
Update:     Removed "partial" thread safety of IPC events.
Workaround: Arg.  UOM just doesn't like dll injection @ 64 bit for me.  Until
            I get this sorted once and for all UOM will target x86 platform.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UO Machine Alpha 1 Revision 4 (06/02/09):

Bugfix:     Fixed broken packet send hook (was only working with Razor).

Bugfix:     Some redundant threading removed.
Bugfix:     Mobile/item status in treeview now updates properly.
Bugfix:     Crash when trying to launch UO client while another is still running.
Bugfix:     Multiple clients now working again with UOM compiled for AnyCPU.
            Previous workaround was to target x86.
Feature:    Now possible to send packets to client, see UOM.SendPacketToClient.
Feature:    Scripts can now reference specific assemblies.  See the Edit menu.
Feature:    Ability to set/clear target cursor: see UOM.SetTargetCursor.
Feature:    Ability to cancel target cursor (same as pressing Esc):
            see UOM.CancelTargetCursor.

Bugfix:     GUI/theme glitches.
Feature:    Local WH_GETMESSAGE hook replaces global keyboard hook and adds
            mouse monitoring capability.
Feature:    Low level events added to IPCEvents class for mouse movement, mouse
            button down/up/click/double-click, mouse wheel use, key down/up,
            and packet send/receive.  ALWAYS unsubscribe from events after use!
Feature:    Last keypress and mouse location added to treeview.  Last keypress
            is meant to aid macro creation so correct Keys enums are used.
