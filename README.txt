UO Machine 0.3.2.4 (03/15/2010)

.Net Framework 3.5 SP1 required

UO Machine is a scripting utility for Ultima Online.  Scripts are
written in C# and execute as native code.

Supported clients:

All Mondain's Legacy/Stygian Abyss 2D clients.

How to write scripts:

It's recommended to use the included Visual Studio 2008 templates
to take advantage of code completion and refactoring features of
the Visual Studio IDE.  Don't forget to add a reference to 
UOMachine.exe in your project.

A GUI template is also included so that you can use the VS 2008
form designer to easily create a GUI script.


Acknowledgements:

Thanks to Artaxerxes, lead developer of UOAI (http://www.uoai.be).  His
assistance has proved invaluable and I appreciate it dearly.

A big thanks to Cheffe.  Though he isn't involved with the project
in any way, UO Machine wouldn't exist without his hard work.  I've
learned much of what I know regarding UO internals by reverse
engineering EasyUO and the UO client.

Thanks to Christoph Husse for EasyHook, a brilliant API hook library.

Thanks to the SharpDevelop team for the nice AvalonEdit library.

Thanks to Daniel 'Necr0Potenc3' Cavalcanti for his hard work on
UO encryption routines which he generously shared with the world.
